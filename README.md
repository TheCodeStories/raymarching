# Black Hole Rendering in Unity

This project is a **Unity Engine** project focused on rendering realistic black holes using raymarching and volumetric techniques.

I made a full **YouTube video** where I explain in detail how everything works:

## Scenes Included

The project contains **4 different scenes**:

1. **Simple Raymarching Demo** â€“ A minimal example to demonstrate the raymarching technique.
2. **Volumetric Cloud Demo** â€“ Shows how volumetric rendering can be used for cloud-like effects.
3. **Black Hole (No Accretion Disk)** â€“ A pure gravitational lensing example without any surrounding matter.
4. **Black Hole with Volumetric Accretion Disk** â€“ A complex black hole surrounded by a volumetric, cloud-like accretion disk.

> **Note:** In the last scene, rendering quality is intentionally reduced to improve performance.  
> To increase quality:
> - **Reduce the step size**
> - **Increase the maximum step count**

## Requirements

- **Unity** (2021.3 LTS or newer recommended)
- A GPU capable of handling raymarching and volumetric rendering
